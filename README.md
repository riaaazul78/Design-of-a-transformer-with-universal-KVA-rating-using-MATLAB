Design-of-a-transformer-with-universal-KVA-rating-using-MATLAB
This project demonstrates the design and analysis of a transformer for any desired kVA rating using MATLAB. The approach is parameterized, meaning that input specifications such as rated power (kVA), supply voltage, frequency, maximum flux density, and current density can be changed, and the script automatically recalculates the transformer core area, turns, conductor sizes, and approximate losses.

Key Features

Universal design: scalable for different kVA ratings.

Uses transformer EMF equation to compute turns and core area:

Estimates primary/secondary currents, conductor cross-sections, and copper losses.

Provides visualization of how core area scales with kVA.

Tools

MATLAB for calculation, parameter sweep, and plotting.

Equations based on standard transformer design rules.

Applications

Educational use in power engineering.

Quick feasibility analysis for transformer specifications.

Basis for extending to detailed CAD / FEM simulations.
